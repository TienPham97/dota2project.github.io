            <p>After an unexpected hiatus, we are pleased to announce the return of the Dota 2 Short Film Contest -- and that we're now accepting submissions for this year's event. Filmmakers have until 3:00pm PDT on July 25, 2021 to submit their short film creations of 90 seconds or less to the Dota 2 Steam Workshop to be eligible for consideration.</p>
            <p>As before, we invite all fans to <a href="3">visit the Workshop</a> to participate in the voting and discussion process to help us select the best entries to be showcased as part of The International 10 broadcast. Upon review of the Workshop ratings and discussions, Valve will nominate the top entries to be featured in the Dota client for a final voting process by the community to determine the winners.</p>
            <p>Each finalist that places in the top ten will be guaranteed to win $500, and the top three selections will reap prizes of $25,000, $10,000, and $5,000 in recognition of their contributions to the Dota community.</p>
            <p>Check out the <a href="3">Dota 2 Short Film Contest site</a> for more information and guidelines on the submission process. And be sure to stop by the Workshop page regularly to help review the submissions you would like to see showcased at The International 10, live from Stockholm in August.</p>
